# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying key variables correlating with heart disease using logistic regression. We analyzed the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, applying logistic regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes models in R to pinpoint crucial health factors. 

## Key Findings
- **Statistical Significance**: Using logistic regression, we identified four critical health variables significantly associated with heart disease: gender, exercise-induced chest pain, ST depression, and asymptomatic chest pain.
- **Model Accuracy**: Our logistic regression model achieved an average accuracy of 80.77%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing data, one-hot encoding, and scaling to ensure data quality.
- Addressed multicollinearity issues and standardized numerical columns for model accuracy.

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: Primary model used for its ability to provide interpretable coefficients and significance levels for each variable.
- **KNN and Naive Bayes**: Applied for comparative analysis to assess model performance and robustness.

## Implications
The study offers actionable insights for public health initiatives by allowing them to design marketing campaigns focused on population segments more likely to develop heart disease.
